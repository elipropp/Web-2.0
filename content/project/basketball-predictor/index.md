Being passionate about data science and sports, I was trying to find a way to merge the two together. I've always seens NBA predictions on apps like theScore, so I figured why not try and predict the games myself. Once the idea was born, my friend Nicholas Khorasani and I started working on it.

This project is currently in development, so as more gets developed I'll update the description.

Currently we've scraped game and team data from online sources, then cleaned and packaged the data so we could use it to create statistical and machine learning models. We're in the process of experimenting with different neural networks and creating a baseline for comparison.

Technologies Used:

- Language: Python
- Data Gathering: BeautifulSoup4
- Data Processing: Pandas
- Models: Numpy, Scikit-Learn and PyTorch
